### ‚ö† Warnings ‚ö†
  Although this GitHub Repository may provide nearly all the programs necessitated for the majority of the class, (as of 2021's class), actually completing the programs by yourself is always the best way to succeed. These programs are intended as **reference-only** and no personal responsibility is taken for the contents of the code. Attempt to code the solutions yourself, and only if you are lost, attempt to integrate and modify certain aspects of this repository into your own code. You should understand exactly what each line of code does before implementing it into your program. Asking others for help is always the best solution.
